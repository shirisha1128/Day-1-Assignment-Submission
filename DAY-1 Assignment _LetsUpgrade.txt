Day 1 Assignment: Difference between Compiler and interpreter

COMPILER

>  A compiler is a program that reads a program written in the high-level language
   and converts it into the machine or low-level language and reports the errors 
   present in the program. 
>  It converts the entire source code in one go or could take multiple passes to do so, but at last, 
   the user gets the compiled code which is ready to execute.

INTERPRETER

>  Interpreters are designed to translate single instruction at a time and execute them immediately.
>  A compiler is comparatively faster than Interpreter as the compiler 
   take the whole program at one go whereas interpreters compile each
   line of code after the other.
